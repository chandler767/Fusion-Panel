# Fusion-Panel
This is a modified version of the [PanelDue Firmware](https://github.com/dc42/PanelDue) for the PanelDue 3D printer user interface board and has been modified for use only for use with the [F400 3D Printer](http://fusion3design.com).

# Changes
This firmware is based off of version 1.13 of the PanelDue Firmware. Most of the changes are in the UI and feature addition/removal for the needs of the F400.

# Instructions
